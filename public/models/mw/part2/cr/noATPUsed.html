    <td><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sorry that is incorrect. Make sure you click on each reaction arrow and look in the 3D molecule area for &quot;ATP&quot; in the reactant side of the equation (the left side) or in the product side (the right side). <br>
      <br>
    You can also see this in the 2D reaction models. When ATP is on the left side of a reaction arrow it is used and on the right sight it is produced.<br>
    <br>
    Don't forget that every reaction after reaction 5 happens twice.</font></p></td>
