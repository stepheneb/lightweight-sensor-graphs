    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rotenone blocks NADH from being able to transfer its electrons to UQ in complex I. However, succinate is still able to transfer its electrons to UQ via complex II.<br>

    </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The problem is that every turn of the Krebs cycle produces 4 NADH molecules and only 1 succinate. Not being able to use the NADH electrons severely limits the electron transport chain and dramatically slows the production of ATP later.</font></p>
